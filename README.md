## What is Linesbox

If a company wants to have a complete 360 view of what’s happening inside its walls, it needs to buy and configure a lot of tools. There is a tool for every specific aspect of a company: HR, project management, time tracking, holidays and time offs, team management, One on Ones,... There isn't a software available today, that combine all of them together in a simple way.

Not only buying and configuring all those software is a time-consuming process, but it also costs a lot of money - especially for smaller companies with a limited budget. Moreover, most of the SAAS out there have a let's-call-us-and-talk-for-an-hour-before-you-can-see-what-the-pricing-will-look-like-for-you policy, which most people hate and that we refuse to follow.

Linesbox is born to offer a solution to these problems.

Linesbox has the following features:
👯 Employee and team management,
📝 Know what you coworkers have done yesterday,
😺 Applicant tracking system,
👨 Employee onboarding,
⛵️ One-on-one management,
🕐 Time tracking,

📃 Documents,
💸 Expenses,
🖥Hardware management,
🚜Project management,
🤖 A way to create automated flows to put your company on autopilot (can’t wait to show this feature to the world),
and many, many other features.
